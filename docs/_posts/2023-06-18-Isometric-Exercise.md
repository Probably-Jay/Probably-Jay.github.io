# Isometric Exercise
> *Perhaps this will change your perspective.*

This was another little game jam I did along with friends *Emelia Fernandez* and *Matt Stark*. 
We had just come back from the V&A's [Design/Play/Disrupt exhibition](https://www.vam.ac.uk/exhibitions/videogames),
and were completely enamoured with Robin Baumgarten's [*The Wobbler*](https://wobblylabs.com/projects/wobbler).

*The Wobbler* is designed to be a 1-Dimensional dungeon crawler, 
with a single input moving the player (a point of light) up and down a single strip of LEDs. 
The controller being an old spring doorstop, apparently inspired by a video of a cat playing with one.

Baumgarten managed to squeeze a huge amount of interaction out of this incredibly simple set-up.
