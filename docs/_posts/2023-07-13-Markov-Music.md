# Markov Music
>"Took me a second to realise the audio was procedural..."

This project was half a piece of coursework for a module on procedural generation that I took in my third year of studies.
We were tasked to create a procedural system which could generate aspects of a game.
I decided to create a procedural soundtrack - to go alongside some terrain generation. 
This resulted in some surprisingly nice music, which you can listen to right below.

As every aspect of this music is procedural, there were several layers to the generation. We'll walk each through them, staring with the most abstract.

### Generating nice chord progressions

### Generating interesting chords


### Generating dynamic melodies


### Generating different pitches


### Creating sound
